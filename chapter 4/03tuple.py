#Tuples is an immutable data type in python
#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
#Tuples are written with round brackets.
#Example
#Create a Tuple:

a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a = (1, ) #If you want to create a tuple with only one element, you need to add a comma after the element
a =()
print (a)
print (type(a))
